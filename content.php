                          If you want to develop the form on your computer, you will need a local server with PHP support. One of the most common solutions is e.g. XAMPP (I use it myself), but there are many more.

The localhost solution, be it XAMPP or similar, will most probably not have any working mail server included. To be able to debug/develop the emails, there are utilities, that simulate the mail server behaviour and instead of sending the email, they save the output/source code of the email to your hard drive. If you are using XAMPP, it comes with the utility called mailtodisk and emails will be saved in xamppfolder/mailoutput. One of the similar solutions can be e.g. MailCatcher, but I don't have any personal experience with it.

To be able to send real email messages, you will need to put the script/page to the internet. To order great web hosting, have a look at iPage - one of the most reliable web hosts on the market. If you are new to them, to will also give you 80% off + many extras. If you're shopping around, put GoDaddy ($1/mo for new customers) or Fat Cow ($3/mo for new customers) on your comparison list too.
