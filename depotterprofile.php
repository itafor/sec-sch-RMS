                       <p style="font-size: 25px; font-family: Arial; ">   De Potter College of Health Technology is a privately owned College of Health Technology duly and fully registered with Corporate Affairs Commission and approved by the Ogun State Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. It is run in affiliation to the Ogun State College of Health Technology, Ilese-Ijebu. The college is managed by seasoned tutors and administrators. The affiliation of the Ogun State College of Health technology, Ilese-Ijebu is a strategy that is designed to benefit the school and its students. Because of the affiliation, the quality of the school is not left to speculations or to the whims of one or a set of individuals. The students of the school will receive at the minimum, the same quality of training as is available to the students of the parent institution. 
Employment is also more assured since they will receive the certificates of the parent institution and receive all the benefits that accrue to the qualification and the certification.
The College offers medical training for prospective health worker in Public Health Nursing, Environmental Health, Community Health, Science laboratories and Computer Studies. The training is available to fresh secondary school graduates (who are interested in health-related courses), graduates who desire further in health disciplines, as well as in-service students and other persons with health related qualifications. The high demand for medical personnel of all cadres in the Nigerian Health Sectors makes the training not only worthwhile but challenging, deeply fulfilling and profitable.
 The College offers standard laboratories which satisfy the requirements of the curriculum and a stocked library that has passed the acid test of the parents institution; a library which eases the book needs of the students as well as spacious and well-ventilated classrooms which support the tedious work required for the medical field to guide the students through research, both paper-based and online as well as community diagnosis. The college e-library with modern computers and internet facilitates is also complementary. Apart from the strictly academic matters, the school devoted time for the well-being of its students. Hotel facilities are provided for students who are interested and social amenities are adequate. Other events like sports day, SUG activities, Health Week all complements the teaching and learning process.
De Potter College of Health Technology has raised the bar so high that even the teachers understand the standard and work hard to achieve it knowing quite well that health related matters are not often the type to give a second chance. Appropriate training is required to fulfill the schools mission, which is to 're-define lost hope'.
It is also in pursuance of this goal that the school has a number of students running on scholarships. Despite providing the better services, fees at De Potter are affordable and relatively cheaper than those offered by competitors.
The admission process for the 2018/2019 session will begin very soon. Intending candidates are free to come to the school to obtain entry forms. The school is located along the road from Oru-ijebu heading to Ijebu-Igbo town in Ogun State in a location very conspicuous to travelers along that route.
We invite and encourage you to be a part of the proud legacy of this institution and build your wards, providing the much needed skills to fit into a fast-changing world.
